and gives you insights about the most expensive modules in terms of coldstart overhead.

## Installation

You can add `treq` package into your AWS Lambda function either by NPM package or by AWS Lambda layer as shown below:

### By NPM package

To install the middleware, you can use NPM:

```
npm install --save treq
```

### By AWS Lambda Layer

You can also add `treq` as layer into your AWS Lambda function.

```
arn:aws:lambda:${region}:273094347961:layer:treq:${layer-version}

```

**Latest layer version:** ![treq](https://api.globadge.com/v1/badgen/aws/lambda/layer/latest-version/us-east-1/273094347961/treq)

**Note:** In the ARN above, you need to replace `${region}` with the actual AWS region you deployed your AWS Lambda function. 


## Usage

* Configure `treq` to be required/bootstrapped automatically at startup by setting `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable:
```
NODE_OPTIONS=-r treq
```

* **Optionally**, you can configure require duration threshold (in milliseconds) for tracing.
  Requires/imports take lower than the threshold are ignored from tracing. 
  By default, the threshold is `10` milliseconds and it can be configured by `TREQ_DURATION_THRESHOLD` environment variable.
  For example:
```
TREQ_DURATION_THRESHOLD=20
```

* **Optionally**, you can configure maximum depth/level limit to trace nested requires/imports.
  Nested requires/imports deeper than the maximum depth/level limit are ignored from tracing.
  By default, the max depth is `100` and it can be configured by `TREQ_MAX_DEPTH` environment variable.
  For example:
```
TREQ_MAX_DEPTH=3
```

* **Optionally**, you can disable `treq` by setting `TREQ_DISABLE` environment variable to `true`. 
  For example:
```
TREQ_DISABLE=true
```
